### Testing with Apollo Client and Server

I tried to use Apollo's front and backend packages to make working with graphql easier. It however added a un-needed layer of complexity. I felt as if I was not going to use many of the features apollo provided, besdies caching, so I deceided to scratch it and keep it simple for my first production graphql project. Perhaps some day I will revist apollo to use their cool features.
